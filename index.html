        <H3> Why is this my Favorite Motorcycle </H3>
        <ul>Full fairing so it blocks the wind and you have music.</ul>
        <ul>It is the lowest motorcycle in it's class and at 5'5" I need the seat to be low.</ul>
        <ul>In 2014 it had the largest stock motor.</ul>
        <ul>I own one!</ul>
